<!-- The https URL link prefix ("https://") is intentionally left off here. This forces links in Markdown docs to use the prefix before this shortcode, which then enables render-link code to correctly recognize the link as a "remote link", which results in a link that will open in a separate tab and render with the "external link" icon next to it. -->github.com/o3de/o3de
